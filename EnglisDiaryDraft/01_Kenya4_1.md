先日は、amazing なサファリの写真をありがとう！  

ところで、ケニアではどんなのを食べたの？  
ケニアの料理って全然分からないんで、聞いてみたい。  


Thank you for sharing amazing photos of Kenyan safari the other day!  

By the way, what did you eat in Kenya?  
I don't know about Kenyan food at all, so I want to hear about it.  


##### Katie
Actually, I was very impressed Kenya's food scene.  

I tried some traditional food from Kenya as well as modern international cuisine.  

We also cooked some meals at home to save money. HAHA.  


##### Me
Sounds good!  

What is Kenyan traditional food?  

Do you have any photos?  


##### Katie
Yeah!  
Here are some photos I took.

This fish is .... sorry, I can't remember the name of the fish.  
But it sounds like piranha.  

I'm sure I will found it immediately when I look it up.  
I'm googling... OK! This is tilapia!  

I had this tilapia when I visited lake Nakuru as this was the local cuisine.  

Kenya is a big country, so you can find various local specialties across the country.  

On the east side of Kenya there are some large lakes, so they eat lots of fresh water fish.  

However, on the west coast of Kenya has lot of influence from Indian and Arabic cultures.  

In Nairobi, you can find any types of the food as it is a metropolitan city.  

Actually, I didn't enjoy the tilapia because it had a lot of bones.  

##### Me
Amazing!  

I thought it was only in Japan that they serve a whole fish like that.  

Normally when I order fish in foreign cuisine restaurants they serve fish that’s been already cut.  

I heard tourists in Japan get really surprised when they see the head of sea bream being served as part of a dish.  

##### Katie
This is another traditional meal I tried.  

It's called 'ugari' which was served with chicken tomato soup.

##### Me
Is it the white round thing?  
Oh! It look like Japanese rice ball.  
How was the taste?  

##### Katie
It doesn't actually taste much.  
It has a texture like dry mashed potato.  

It's nice when you have it with the soup.  

##### Me
That's intreating!  

##### Katie
I also tried lamb dry curry with some boiled vegetables.  
This was a free meal for the staff in the hospital I was working in.

##### Me
That's good!  
You could eat free meal.  

By the way, you talked about the meals in the hospital.  
Did you go to any restaurants?  

##### Katie
Yeah!  
I tried a few.  

This one was my favorite.

This is the view from the restaurant.  
It was by the Diani Beach on the east coast.  

I can't remember the name, but the view was amazing, and food was tasty so we went there twice.

We shared starters and we ordered some tacos and calamari.  
They were really tasty!

This was my main meal.  
It had an Asian twist to it so I really enjoyed it.  
I was craving some Asian food towards the end of the trip.  

##### Me
That's such an amazing view!  

Is it a common tacos, by the way?  

##### Katie
Yeah! I think so.  
It was better than some tacos I have tried in the UK.  

##### Me
Really?  

I didn't expect that!  

But tacos is not from the UK, so it is not surprising that other countries can  make it more tasty.  

Is this rice on the right side of the second picture.  
It seems different from Japanese rice.  

##### Katie
Yeah! I think it was jasmine rice.  
It is common in China and I think most rice I had in Kenya was also jasmine rice.  

##### Me
Really I haven't tried it.  

Do you have any other photos?  

##### Katie
Yes!
We also went to an Indian restaurant.

There are so many Indian restaurant in Kenya because there are a lot of migrants from India.  

This one was owned by an Indian family and it was very authentic.  

My favorite was okura fries.  

##### Me
Oh! They look like really authentic Indian dishes!  

I have never heard of okura fries.  

And, I always thought "okura" was Japanese.
