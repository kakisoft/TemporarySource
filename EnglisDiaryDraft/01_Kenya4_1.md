先日は、amazing なサファリの写真をありがとう！

ところで、ケニアではどんなのを食べたの？
ケニアの料理って全然分からないんで、聞いてみたい。


Thank you for sharing amazing photos of Kenyan safari the other day!

By the way, what did you eat in Kenya?
I don't know about Kenyan food at all, so I want to hear about it.


##### Katie
Actually, I was very impressed Kenya's food scene.

I tried some traditional food from Kenya as well as modern international cuisine.

We also cooked some meals at home to save money. HAHA.


##### Me
Sounds good!

What is Kenyan traditional food?

Do you have any photos?


##### Katie
Yeah!
Here are some photos I took.

This fish is .... sorry, I can't remember the name of the fish.
But it sounds like piranha.

I'm sure I will found it immediately when I look it up.
I'm googling... OK! This is tilapia!

I had this tilapia when I visited lake Nakuru as this was the local cuisine.

Kenya is a big country, so you can find various local specialties across the country.

On the east side of Kenya there are some large lakes, so they eat lots of fresh water fish.

However, on the west coast of Kenya has lot of influence from Indian and Arabic cultures.

In Nairobi, you can find any types of the food as it is a metropolitan city.

Actually, I didn't enjoy the tilapia because it had a lot of bones.

Amazing!

魚そのものの形が料理として出てくるのって、日本ぐらいだと思ってたよ。

外国で魚料理って言ったら、既にカットされた魚の切り身が出てくるし。

タイのおかしらとか見たら、海外の人ってびっくりするって聞いたよ。
