先日は、amazing なサファリの写真をありがとう！  

ところで、ケニアではどんなのを食べたの？  
ケニアの料理って全然分からないんで、聞いてみたい。  


Thank you for sharing amazing photos of Kenyan safari the other day!  

By the way, what did you eat in Kenya?  
I don't know about Kenyan food at all, so I want to hear about it.  


##### Katie
Actually, I was very impressed Kenya's food scene.  

I tried some traditional food from Kenya as well as modern international cuisine.  

We also cooked some meals at home to save money. HAHA.  


##### Me
Sounds good!  

What is Kenyan traditional food?  

Do you have any photos?  


##### Katie
Yeah!  
Here are some photos I took.

This fish is .... sorry, I can't remember the name of the fish.  
But it sounds like piranha.  

I'm sure I will found it immediately when I look it up.  
I'm googling... OK! This is tilapia!  

I had this tilapia when I visited lake Nakuru as this was the local cuisine.  

Kenya is a big country, so you can find various local specialties across the country.  

On the east side of Kenya there are some large lakes, so they eat lots of fresh water fish.  

However, on the west coast of Kenya has lot of influence from Indian and Arabic cultures.  

In Nairobi, you can find any types of the food as it is a metropolitan city.  

Actually, I didn't enjoy the tilapia because it had a lot of bones.  

##### Me
Amazing!  

I thought it was only in Japan that they serve a whole fish like that.  

Normally when I order fish in foreign cuisine restaurants they serve fish that’s been already cut.  

I heard tourists in Japan get really surprised when they see the head of sea bream being served as part of a dish.  

##### Katie
This is another traditional meal I tried.  

It's called 'ugari' which was served with chicken tomato soup.

Is it the white round thing?  
Oh! It look like Japanese rice ball.  
How was the taste?  

##### Katie
It doesn't actually taste much.  
It has a texture like dry mashed potato.  

It's nice when you have it with the soup.  

##### Me
That's intreating!  

##### Katie
I also tried lamb dry curry with some boiled vegetables.  
This was a free meal for the staff in the hospital I was working in.

##### Me
That's good!  
You could eat free meal.  

By the way, you talked about the meals in the hospital.  
Did you go to any restaurants?  

##### Katie
Yeah!  
I tried a few.  

This one was my favorite.
