Visiting the Kenyan capital city

この前、ケニアに研修に行った時の事を話してくれたけど、観光はしなかったの？  
By the way, you told me about your medical placement in Kenya.  
Did you go sightseeing there?  

観光とか楽しんできたなら、その話を聞かせて。  
Do you mind sharing what you did?  

## Katie
Of course!  

On the weekends, I went to three national parks and during weekday evenings I went to explore Nairobi city.

## kaki
Sounds great!

アフリカの都市とか全然想像できないけど、どんな感じだった？（どんな雰囲気だった？　あなたはどう感じた？）  
I can't imagine an African city. How was it like?  

## Katie
It was pretty busy. There were lots of people and so many cars.

Some areas were more developed than the other and in those areas, there were quite a few nice restaurant, bars and shops.

## kaki
Cool!  

アフリカのおしゃれなレストランとかバーって、イメージ無かった！  
I did't know that there were fancy restaurants and bars.  

Nairobi で画像検索してみたけど、すごい映像出てくるね。これ、本当にアフリカ？？  
I tried searching "Nairobi" on Google image, there are many modern buildings. Is it really Africa?  

## Katie
だよね！（でしょ！）  
I know right!  

Not all of Nairobi is like that.  
There is a huge gap between the rich and the poor.  

Some areas are deprived and have many slums.

## kaki
I see.
（そうなんだ）  

Did you visit both areas?  

## Katie
Yeah! I did.  

I was surprised how good the restaurants were. I really enjoyed the night life there.  
But, walking through the slums was intreating as well as shocking because you can see how different people's lives were within the same city.  

## kaki
Really?  

スラム歩いてるときとか、身の危険を感じたりしなかった？  
When you walked through the slums, didn't you feel unsafe?  

## Katie
Maybe a little bit.  

I noticed that the people were staring at me and some people shouted "Chinese" at me.  

Well, I suppose my skin color is different.  

## kaki
へー。　アジア人って、そんなに珍しがられるんだ？  
Oh!  
Are there not many Asians in Nairobi?  

## Katie
Actually, there are a few Chinese people.  
There is even a China town.  

But, there aren't many other Asian people.  

## kaki
へー。  
中国がアフリカのインフラを整備してるって話は聞いたことあるけど、そこまで生活に浸透してるんだね。  

Oh wow!  
I heard that the Chinese government are investing in African infrastructure.  
The chinese people are here to stay!  

## Katie
Yeah! That's right!  

But, when you tell them that you are a Japanese, they are very welcoming as well.
